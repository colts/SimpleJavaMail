== Why Simple Java Mail being RFC compliant is important ==

One thing that plagues other smaller libraries is the lack of true RFC compliance. Though fine for simple mails, this becomes a testing nightmare if for example you need to send an HTML mail (with text fall-back?) using both attachment and embedded images.

The problem becomes evident when testing the mail in various e-mail clients (both desktop and web based) by the fact that the e-mails will be displayed completely inconsistent and sporadic. Symptoms include:
  * not seeing embedded images, or
  * embedded images are displayed as attachments,
  * not seeing the HTML version, 
  * not seeing attachments,
  * attachments aren't handled correctly according to mime type ,or
  * header information is missing or incorrect so you can't see how long a download will take, 
  * from/to addresses being malformed (like missing the _<name>_ part in _<name> ares@domain.com_)

To realize the Simple Java Mail library, the research has been done and this library is RFC compliant for complex mails which furthermore has been tested by a professional test team to be displayed consistent and correctly in a range of known clients such as Outlook, Thunderbird, Gmail, Hotmail etc.

= Introduction =

Vesijama is a wrapper framework for the javax.mail API for sending emails over smtp. Vesijama stands for Very Simple Java Mail and is designed to be as easy to use as possible, while still being able to do everything you want when sending email. 

= Alternatives =

There are some alternatives around, such as the [http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/1.2.x/reference/mail.html Spring mailing framework] or the [http://commons.apache.org/email/userguide.html Apache Commons Mail]. However, Spring works a bit awkward with anonymous subclasses and stuff (and you need Spring in your dependencies), while Apache Commons Mail isn't as simple as it could be.

= Example usage =

{{{
final Email email = new Email();

email.setFromAddress("lollypop", "lolly.pop@somemail.com");
email.setSubject("hey");
email.addRecipient("C. Cane", "candycane@candyshop.org", RecipientType.TO);
email.addRecipient("C. Bo", "chocobo@candyshop.org", RecipientType.BCC);
email.setText("We should meet up! ;)");
email.setTextHTML("<b>We should meet up!</b><img src='cid:wink'>");

// embed image and include downloadable attachment
email.addEmbeddedImage("wink", imagedata);
email.addAttachment("invitation", pdfdata, "application/pdf");

new Mailer("smtp.host.com", 25, "username", "password").sendMail(email);
}}}

You can also pass in your own preconfigured mail Session instance, so this framework is backwards compatible with whatever you use now.

Vesijama uses a couple of jars that are all opensource. These are the Apache log4j library and Sun JavaMail API library. It uses the javax.activation package as well, which is shipped with JavaEE or is available as seperate package.

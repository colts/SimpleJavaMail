== Concerning the log4j warning ==

By default, you may get two warnings as follows:

{{{
log4j:WARN No appenders could be found for logger (org.codemonkey.vesijama.Mailer).
log4j:WARN Please initialize the log4j system properly.
}}}

This is because Simple Java Mail uses the log4j logging library which needs you to define how you want your logging.

A quick solution if you're not interested in any of this, just copy paste the following snipper in your own application.

{{{
// normally you would do this in the log4j.xml
Logger rootLogger = Logger.getRootLogger();
rootLogger.addAppender(new ConsoleAppender(new SimpleLayout()));
rootLogger.setLevel(Level.INFO);
}}}

This configures the logging framework to log to the console (system.out) and log only info-level messages and above.
